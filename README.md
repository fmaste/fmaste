  - I built my first Haskell tool used in production at the end of 2011.
    Tired of having to test before and after every release at work, I built my own domain specific language embedded in Haskell (EDSL) to avoid doing manual testing.
    I also build a [web console](https://github.com/fmaste/HeleniumConsole) for the team to create, edit and run the tests with just a a web browser while providing a nice output of the whole run (screeshots, debug, assertions, warnings, etc).

  - Here I made public a 2016 tool I created that was also a research project on GHC [internals](https://github.com/fmaste/Mafia/blob/master/docs/Executable.md).
    I was having problems with Cabal at that time so I built my own alternative with reproducible builds.
- https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/3670
  - My contribution to Haskell's Cabal that got merged. I needed to package projects with [auto generated modules](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/cabal-package.html#autogenerated-modules-and-includes) and it was not working as expected.

  - Still a work-in-progress. Building a little summary of everything I have read and know about Haskell and Theoretical Computer Science.
    For example, [notes](https://github.com/fmaste/Haskell/blob/master/doc/EDSL.md) and [source code](https://github.com/fmaste/Haskell/blob/master/src/EDSL.hs) about different ways of building an EDSL in Haskell.
- https://github.com/fmaste/jsMVC
  - The web console mentioned above was built with a JavaScript MVC framework I created.
- https://github.com/fmaste/hansible
  - A little tool to generate a Graphviz DOT description file from Ansible hosts.
